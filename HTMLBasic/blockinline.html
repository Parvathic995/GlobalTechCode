	<p>
Block-level elements render (i.e., are displayed) to begin on a new line by default. You can change that behavior with CSS but weâ€™re not talking about CSS at this point, yet.

What that means is every time you specify a block-level element in HTML, the browser will automatically place the contents of that element on a new line in the flow of the document.
